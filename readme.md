# Printer Management Web Application

This is a simple printer management system that allows you to view all the printers on-site. You can view the brand, model, location, IP address, MAC address, manufacture date, and comments for each printer. You can also add a new printer, edit an existing printer, or delete a printer if you have the correct access.
